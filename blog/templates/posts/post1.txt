Today was the first day at Villiers Park. We had a session on lambda calculus which was interesting. Our project for the week is to make a blog in a specific programming language. Mine is python.
Our next session was on problem solving and being lazy. This involves breaking down a big problem into smaller questions and answering these questions. Being lazy is when you are more efficient, by not repeating yourself and not overcomplicating anything.
